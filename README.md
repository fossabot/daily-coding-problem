# Daily Coding Problem

Once I decided to solve one coding problem a day (or at least try to).

This repository contains my solutions to these coding problems. All of them were provided by [dailycodingproblem.com](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com)

## Find a sum in array (SumInArray.java)

This problem was recently asked by Google.

Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.

For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.

Bonus: Can you do this in one pass?
